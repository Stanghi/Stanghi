## âœŒ About me
I'm an Italian student at the University of Rome La Sapienza.
In high school, I studied computer science and telecommunication, which gave me, in addition to a great passion for this world, a good programming basis of HTML, CSS, JS, and C.
After high school, I decided to attend the University to learn more things than I would have done as a freelancer.
I have many projects on my to-do list, but before uploading them to GitHub, I first want to be sure of the efficiency of the code in all its forms. You never stop learning!
My dream is to work in the IT field since I was a child, and I will do everything to succeed. But first, I hope to get my degree. lol
