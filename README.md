## âœŒ About me
Hi, my name is Mattia Stangherlin. aka Stanghi.

I'm an Italian student at the University of Rome La Sapienza.

In high school, I studied computer science and telecommunication, which gave me, in addition to a great passion for this world, a good programming basis of `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, and `C`.

After high school, I decided to continue to study computer science at the University to learn more things than I would have done as a freelancer.

I have many projects on my to-do list, but before uploading them to Github, I first want to be sure of the efficiency of the code in all its forms.
You never stop learning!

My dream is to work in the IT field since I was a child, and I will do everything to succeed. 
But first, I hope to get my degree. lol
